\section*{Aircraft Database}

\begin{par}
This generates the database of information for all scheduled aircrafts on a given day. The number of customers in a day is random from a range, clustered around the max of that range close to Thanksgiving and Christmas. The objective is to minimize the amount of time each passenger spends waiting and maximize the amount of passengers in an AC. Suppose a flight is scheduled every 15 minutes.
